This lesson introduces you to the PHP programming language, including its history, evolution, and key features. You will learn about the early days of PHP, its adoption by web developers, and how it has continued to evolve over the years.

**Examples with Solutions**

### Example 1: Early Days of PHP (1994-2000)

In this example, we will look at how PHP was first developed in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. We will also explore some of the early features and challenges faced by the PHP community.

* **HTML Code:** `<h1>Early Days of PHP</h1>`
* **CSS Code:** `/* no CSS code */`
* **JavaScript Code:** `/* no JavaScript code */`
* **Program Code:**
```php
<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```
### Example 2: Adoption by Web Developers (2000-2010)

In this example, we will explore how PHP became widely adopted by web developers in the early 2000s. We will also look at some of the key features and libraries that were developed during this period.

* **HTML Code:** `<h1>PHP Adoption</h1>`

  declare(strict_types=1);
  $x = 5;
  echo (string)$x . "\n";
?>
```
### Example 5: PHP in the Cloud

In this example, we will explore how PHP has been adapted for use in cloud-based environments. We will look at some of the key challenges and opportunities that arise when using PHP in the cloud.

* **HTML Code:** `<h1>PHP in the Cloud</h1>`
